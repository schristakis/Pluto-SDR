##################    OVERVIEW   ######################

SDRAngel is a general purpose software defined radio program that is compatible with most SDRs including the Pluto SDR.

The built in applications include:

- ADS-B Decoder: Decodes aircraft ADS-B data and plots aircraft positions on a map

- NOAA APT Decoder: Decodes NOAA weather satellite images (in black and white only)

- DVB-S: Decodes and plays Digital TV DVB-S and DVB-S2 video

- AIS: Decodes marine AIS data and plots vessel positions on a map

- VOR: Decodes VOR aircraft navigational beacons, and plots bearing lines on a map, allowing you to determine your receivers position.

- DAB+: Decodes and plays DAB digital audio signals

- Radio Astronomy Hydrogen Line: With an appropriate radio telescope connected to the SDR, integrates and displays the Hydrogen Line FFT with various settings, and a map of the galaxy showing where your dish is pointing. Can also control a dish rotator.

-Radio Astronomy Solar Observations: Similar to the Hydrogen line app, allows you to make solar measurements.

-Broadcast FM: Decoding and playback. Includes RDS decoding.
 
- Noise Figure Measurements: Together with a noise source you can measure the noise figure of a SDR.

- Airband Voice: Receive multiple Airband channels simultaneously

- Graves Radar Tracker: For Europeans, track a satellite and watch for reflections in the spectrum from the French Graves space radar. 

- Radio Clocks: Receive and decode accurate time from radio clocks such as MSF, DCF77, TDF and WWVB.

- APRS: Decode APRS data, and plot APRS locations and moving APRS enabled vehicles on a map with speed plot.

- Pagers: Decode POCSAG pagers

- APRS/AX.25 Satellite: Decode APRS messages from the ISS and NO-84 satellites, via the built in decoder and satellite tracker.

- Channel Analyzer: Analyze signals in the frequency and time domains

- QSO Digital and Analog Voice: Decode digital and analog voice. Digital voice handled by the built in DSD demodulator, and includes DMR, dPMR and D-Star.

- Beacons: Monitor propagation via amateur radio beacons, and plot them on a map.
