When pluto is connected to the host machine, find and open the config.txt file.
In order to access Pluto via ethernet we need to update the [ETHERNET] settings of the PlutoSDR.
Go under [ETHERNET] and change the ipaddr_eth to the desired IP. 
Caution: the IP must belong to the subnet of the LAN.
(In my case the LAN uses 10.64.45.45 subnet and the IP I gave Pluto is 10.64.45.45)
Then, save the configured file and eject (not unplug) the PlutoSDR device from your host.
Wait for 5 seconds
Finally unplug the SDR device and plug it in back and the IP should have been changed successfully

SETUP:
After configuring the config.txt file, we connect the power usb port of Pluto to turn it on.
On the other usb port (which is for data transfering) we plug an ethernet adapter, which has 
a usb port compatible to Pluto's port on one side and a female ethernet port on the other side.
Then we connect the female ethernet port of the adapter to the desired LAN via an Ethernet cable.
Ping the IP of pluto (ping 10.64.45.45) to confirm that we can actually send data to Pluto.
To access Pluto run -> ssh root@your_Pluto_Eth_IP (In my case-> ssh root@10.64.45.45) and the password is "analog".
