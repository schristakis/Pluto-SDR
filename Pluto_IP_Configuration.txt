When pluto is connected to the host machine, find and open the config.txt file.
In order to change the IP we need to update the [NETWORK] settings of the PlutoSDR ipaddr (default is 192.168.2.1), 
and your host PC settings ipaddr_host (default is 192.168.2.10).
The ip_addr and the  ipaddr_host must be unique, and must be on the same subnet.
Change the ip_addr to the desired IP and configure ipaddr so they belong to the same subnet.
Then, save the configured file and eject (not unplug) the PlutoSDR device from your host.
Wait for 5 seconds
Finally unplug the SDR device and plug it in back and the IP should have been changed successfully.
